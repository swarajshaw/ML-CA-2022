# ML-CA-2022
Design and Implementation of Machine Learning Models - Algorithm and Model Development

The first assignment is a group assignment.
Groups/students must submit the final group report as an appendix to the main report. 
The report should include notes of group meetings and a note from each individual group member specifying the precise nature of their contribution to the final product, and the estimated time of completion. 

The report must include the following:

- Background of the model architecture for three ML models. Scope including type of the Machine Learning models and mathematical requirements with the List of rules for each model (20 marks).
- Dataset implemented without error (30 marks).
- Machine Learning design, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses and artefact (20 marks).
- Conclusions and Bibliography. Screenshots and explanations must be provided where required (10 marks).
- Presentation (20 marks).

Assignments objectives
1.	Analyse the requirements according to the organisation’s goals and present multiple ML models.
2.	Design different Machine Learning models.
3.	Implement different Machine Learning algorithms for a typical real-world problem.
4.	Demonstrate Machine Learning models using a well-stablished artefact.

| `Report`        | Insufficient or incomplete report with poor or incomplete data model, no/poor normalisation, poor explanation, etc.         | Some but insufficient and poorly written report with poorly developed data model, explanation not enough to meet the requirements   |   Sufficient explanation but lack of attention to good report writing skills   |   Well-structured and well-written report with good specifications and data model    |   Excellent solution to problem proving originality, creativity and evidence of research – very well written with excellent data model   |
| `Machine Learning Model Development`   |   Not properly structured, No/poor implementation of Model algorithms   | Insufficiently structured with some implementation of Model algorithms in very limited situations.   |   Sufficient implementation but lack of attention to details of the model. Intermediate level of understanding the ML algorithms   |   Well-structured and well-implemented model with good specifications and relevant data model. Sound knowledge of the topic.    |   Excellent model developer who can work in different contexts that meets all the business requirements   |
| `Demonstration`        | Very Weak demonstration with no knowledge/understanding of the model     | Weak demonstration showing little knowledge of different aspects of the model.   |   Average demonstration showing some knowledge of relevant issues.   |   Good demonstration showing good knowledge of the model and the relevant issues.    |   Excellent demonstration showing excellent knowledge of the model and relevant details   |
